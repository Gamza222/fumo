/**
 * Error mock types
 *
 * Contains only types that are actually used in the error mock system.
 * Currently only supports reset function mocking for ErrorBoundary testing.
 */

// No types are currently needed since createMockResetFunction uses jest.MockedFunction directly
// This file is kept for future expansion if additional error mock types are needed
